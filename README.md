# LLM Seminar and Workshop Materials

This repository contains materials from a seminar/workshop focused on Large Language Models (LLMs).  It includes a hands-on notebook covering key concepts and demonstrations of practical LLM projects.

## Contents

*   **LLM Workshop Notebook:** This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive overview of LLMs, covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications.

    *   **Topics Covered:**
        *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) Basics
        *   Accessing LLMs (e.g., through APIs)
        *   Understanding the differences between Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Fine-tuning, and Full Training
        *   In-depth exploration of RAG
        *   Introduction to LLM Agents

*   **LLM Projects:** This section showcases several projects developed using LLMs, demonstrating their capabilities in different domains.

    *   **Blog Generator:** An LLM-powered project that automatically generates blog posts based on provided prompts or keywords. 
    *   **Link Sage:**   For example:  A project that uses LLMs to intelligently curate and summarize relevant links based on a given topic.
    *   **Style Gen:**  For example: A project that uses LLMs to generate text in different writing styles.
