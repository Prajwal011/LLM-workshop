# LLM Seminar and Workshop Materials

This repository contains materials from a seminar/workshop focused on Large Language Models (LLMs).  It includes a hands-on notebook covering key concepts and demonstrations of practical LLM projects.

## Contents

*   **LLM Workshop Notebook:** This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive overview of LLMs, covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications.

    *   **Topics Covered:**
        *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) Basics
        *   Accessing LLMs (e.g., through APIs)
        *   Understanding the differences between Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Fine-tuning, and Full Training
        *   In-depth exploration of RAG
        *   Introduction to LLM Agents

*   **LLM Projects:** This section showcases several projects developed using LLMs, demonstrating their capabilities in different domains.

    *   **Blog Generator:** An LLM-powered project that automatically generates blog posts based on provided prompts or keywords.  *(Further details about this project, such as specific techniques used or example outputs, could be added here)*
    *   **Link Sage:**  *(Describe the Link Sage project here. What does it do? What LLM techniques does it use?)*  For example:  A project that uses LLMs to intelligently curate and summarize relevant links based on a given topic.
    *   **Style Gen:** *(Describe the Style Gen project here. What does it do? What LLM techniques does it use?)* For example: A project that uses LLMs to generate text in different writing styles.

## Getting Started

To get started with these materials, you will need to:

1.  Clone this repository:  `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repository-name].git` (Replace with your actual repository URL)
2.  Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd [your-repository-name]`
3.  *(Add specific instructions for setting up the environment.  This is crucial!)*  For example:
    *   Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (If you have a `requirements.txt` file)
    *   Ensure you have access to the necessary LLM APIs and have configured your credentials.  *(Provide specific instructions on how to do this, including any API keys or environment variables that need to be set)*
4.  Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook LLM_workshop_notebook.ipynb`
